                    <p>Last updated September 25, 2019</p>


                    <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using
                        the https://zerobalance.click website (the "Service") operated by Zero Balance ("us", "we", or
                        "our").</p>

                    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with
                        these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
                    </p>

                    <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any
                        part of the terms then you may not access the Service. The Terms and Conditions agreement for
                        Zero Balance has been created with the help of <a
                            href="https://www.termsfeed.com/">TermsFeed</a>.</p>




                    <h2>Links To Other Web Sites</h2>

                    <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or
                        controlled by Zero Balance.</p>

                    <p>Zero Balance has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy
                        policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and
                        agree that Zero Balance shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any
                        damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any
                        such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>

                    <p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party
                        web sites or services that you visit.</p>


                    <h2>Termination</h2>

                    <p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability,
                        for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

                    <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                        termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
                        indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>



                    <h2>Governing Law</h2>

                    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of New Zealand, without
                        regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

                    <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
                        those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court,
                        the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
                        agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we
                        might have between us regarding the Service.</p>


                    <h2>Changes</h2>

                    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a
                        revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms
                        taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

                    <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to
                        be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the
                        Service.</p>
